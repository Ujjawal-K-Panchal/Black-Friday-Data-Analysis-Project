# Black-Friday-Data-Analysis-Project

# Overview :

Black Friday is an informal name for the day following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, the
fourth Thursday of November, which has been regarded as the beginning of the
country's Christmas shopping season since 1952.

Most major retailers open very early, as early as overnight hours, and offer promotional sales.
Black Friday is not an official holiday, but California and some other states observe "The Day After
Thanksgiving" as a holiday for state government employees, sometimes in lieu of another federal
holiday, such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving
and the following Friday off, which, along with the following regular weekend, makes it a fourday
weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.

Black Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States since
2005, although news reports, which at that time were inaccurate, have described it as the busiest
shopping day of the year for a much longer period of time. Similar stories resurface year upon
year at this time, portraying hysteria and shortage of stock, creating a state of positive feedback.4

In our project, we conduct a brief study on analysis of sales during Black Friday and make various other
commercially beneficial predictions which could be used by a retailer to make data driven and profit promising
decisions. Our dataset is collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sdolezel/black-friday).
